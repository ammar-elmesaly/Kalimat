# Kalimat

This is an implementation of the very famous game wordle using Godot Engine in Arabic language.

This project is done using Godot v4.3, a famous light game engine. It's supposed to be an Arabic version of the game wordle. I chose the name "Kalimat" meaning "Words" in Arabic.

# DISCLAIMER:

I couldn't find a suitable Arabic Dictionary. The ones I found are either too shallow not containing most of the words, or too complicated containing "non-sense words". The current one I am using doesn't have most of the common words, so game guesses are open (you can guess non-sense words unlike the real game). If you found a suitable Arabic dictionary (preferably in txt form or any other relevant form) please don't hesitate to pull request! (Or if you find improvement to the logic somehow). But Apart from that the logic is working fine. Enjoy playing!
